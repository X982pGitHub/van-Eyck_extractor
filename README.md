    2. Paste it on your online IDE of choice. I would recommend [Replit](https://replit.com/)
    3. Create two folder in the IDE. Name it exactly:
       - Cell
       - Vertical
    4. It should work now. Many online interpreter doesn't support file saving so you may need to switch if error repeatedly occured. If you believe it's a bug, go and read [Reporting bugs](Reporting_bugs_-_รายงานข้อบกพร่อง). Follows the steps there.
    
    **Limitation** - This process doesn't work on many interpreter. Even it *Replit,* maximum memory is 400Mb, which meant you may not be able to compile very large image.
